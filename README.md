# infuspect
Code for Optical IFU Data Inspection
'infuspect' is a code that can help with visual inspection of IFU data completely written in python. To run the code, the following python modules are required - 

warnings
numpy
matplotlib
astropy
sys
os
scipy
mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1
sklearn
statsmodels
progress.bar
re
pandas


The code is run on python-3, but should be easily tranportable to other version with little change.
To run the code, just go to main_code.py and change the redshift of the system and the IFU fits file name. And run the code - "python main_code.py"
The functionalities are self-explanatory. Should not be very hard to understand.

Note: The code is now written for KMOS data specifically but should be easily extendable to other IFU instruments.
